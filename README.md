# cakebear
cakebear is not a new language per se but rather allows developers to write in TypeScript &amp; then compiles that code down to a single executable. The goal is to get close to or as performant is GoLang or Rust. These languages are gaining popularity due to their performance &amp; ease of deployment (though they are created to do different things) but they have a very steep learning curve. This language will be designed to help new developers who are much more familiar with JS / TS still write very performant code so this language can be adopted to allow for a much more diverse hiring process in tech companies without sacrificing performance.
